# ExpressRouteGen

This is a tool I created to generate a Controller, Model, Service and Route for Node.js + Express Applications.
I wanted something to help me increase the speed of my development process, so I created this extension.
Its not perfect, but it works for me.

I will try to update it as I learn more about Express and Node.js.

## Future Ideas
 - Auto detect the base folder for the MVC structure
 - Add Route to index/server/app.ts files.
